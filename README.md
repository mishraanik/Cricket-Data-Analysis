# Cricket-Data-Analysis
Performed comprehensive data analysis on cricket-related datasets to derive meaningful insights into player and team performance, identify patterns, and visualize trends.


## Key Components:

### Data Collection:

Acquire datasets containing information about cricket matches, players, teams, and relevant statistics.
Kaggle Dataset

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data.
